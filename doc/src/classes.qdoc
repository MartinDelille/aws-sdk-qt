    \brief Classes and members marked obsolete that should not be used in new code.

    \section1 C++ classes that are deprecated

    The following Qt C++ classes are now obsolete. Obsolete classes
    are no longer maintained. They are provided to keep old source
    code working, but they can be removed in a future release. We
    strongly advise against using these classes in new code.
