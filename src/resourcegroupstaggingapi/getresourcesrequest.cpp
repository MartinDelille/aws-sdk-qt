 *
 *  <fullname>Resource Groups Tagging API</fullname>
 * 
 *  This guide describes the API operations for the resource groups
 * 
 *  tagging>
 * 
 *  A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag consists of a key and a value, both of which you define. For
 *  example, if you have two Amazon EC2 instances, you might assign both a tag key of "Stack." But the value of "Stack"
 *  might be "Testing" for one and "Production" for the
 * 
 *  other>
 * 
 *  Tagging can help you organize your resources and enables you to simplify resource management, access management and cost
 *  allocation. For more information about tagging, see <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html">Working with Tag Editor</a> and <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/resource-groups.html">Working with Resource Groups</a>.
 *  For more information about permissions you need to use the resource groups tagging APIs, see <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/obtaining-permissions-for-resource-groups.html">Obtaining
 *  Permissions for Resource Groups </a> and <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/obtaining-permissions-for-tagging.html">Obtaining
 *  Permissions for Tagging
 * 
 *  </a>>
 * 
 *  You can use the resource groups tagging APIs to complete the following
 * 
 *  tasks> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Tag and untag supported resources located in the specified region for the AWS
 * 
 *  accoun> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Use tag-based filters to search for resources located in the specified region for the AWS
 * 
 *  accoun> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  List all existing tag keys in the specified region for the AWS
 * 
 *  accoun> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  List all existing values for the specified key in the specified region for the AWS
 * 
 *  accoun> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  Not all resources can have tags. For a lists of resources that you can tag, see <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/supported-resources.html">Supported Resources</a> in the
 *  <i>AWS Resource Groups and Tag Editor User
 * 
 *  Guide</i>>
 * 
 *  To make full use of the resource groups tagging APIs, you might need additional IAM permissions, including permission to
 *  access the resources of individual services as well as permission to view and apply tags to those resources. For more
 *  information, see <a
