 *
 * \ingroup aws-clients
 * \inmodule QtAwsEKS
 *
 *  Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run
 *  Kubernetes on AWS without needing to stand up or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an
 *  open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  Amazon EKS runs three Kubernetes control plane instances across three Availability Zones to ensure high availability.
 *  Amazon EKS automatically detects and replaces unhealthy control plane instances, and it provides automated version
 *  upgrades and patching for
 * 
 *  them>
 * 
 *  Amazon EKS is also integrated with many AWS services to provide scalability and security for your applications,
 *  including the following:
 * 
 *  </p <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  Elastic Load Balancing for load
 * 
 *  distributio> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  IAM for
 * 
 *  authenticatio> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  Amazon VPC for
 * 
 *  isolatio> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  Amazon EKS runs up to date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so you can use all the existing plugins and
 *  tooling from the Kubernetes community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications running
 *  on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises data centers or public clouds. This means that
 *  you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification

 * <code>logs</code>, and <code>proxy</code> data
 *
 * flows)>
 *
 * After you create an Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure your Kubernetes tooling to communicate with the API server
