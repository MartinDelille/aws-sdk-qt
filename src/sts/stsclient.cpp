 * \brief The StsClient class provides access to the AWS Security Token Service ( STS) service.
 *
 * \ingroup aws-clients
 * \inmodule QtAwsSTS
 *
 *  <fullname>AWS Security Token Service</fullname>
 * 
 *  The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege
 *  credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate (federated users).
 *  This guide provides descriptions of the STS API. For more detailed information about using this service, go to <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html">Temporary Security Credentials</a>.
 * 
 *  </p <note>
 * 
 *  As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for
 *  various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to
 *  create programmatic access to STS. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing
 *  errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install
 *  them, see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services page</a>.
 * 
 *  </p </note>
 * 
 *  For information about setting up signatures and authorization through the API, go to <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html">Signing AWS API Requests</a> in the
 *  <i>AWS General Reference</i>. For general information about the Query API, go to <a

 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  <b>Endpoints</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  The AWS Security Token Service (STS) has a default endpoint of https://sts.amazonaws.com that maps to the US East (N.
 *  Virginia) region. Additional regions are available and are activated by default. For more information, see <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html">Activating and
 *  Deactivating AWS STS in an AWS Region</a> in the <i>IAM User

 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sts_region">Regions and Endpoints</a> in the <i>AWS
 *  General
 * 
 *  Reference</i>>
 * 
 *  <b>Recording API requests</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  STS supports AWS CloudTrail, which is a service that records AWS calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an
 *  Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were successfully made
 *  to STS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on
 *  and find your log files, see the <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html">AWS CloudTrail User

 *
 * Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security
 * token) that you can use to access AWS resources that you might not normally have access to. Typically, you use
 * <code>AssumeRole</code> for cross-account access or federation. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRole</code> with the
 * other APIs that produce temporary credentials, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html">Requesting Temporary Security

 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison">Comparing the
 * AWS STS APIs</a> in the <i>IAM User
 *
 * Guide</i>>
 *
 * <b>Important:</b> You cannot call <code>AssumeRole</code> by using AWS root account credentials; access is denied. You
 * must use credentials for an IAM user or an IAM role to call <code>AssumeRole</code>.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need to access resources in each account. You could
 * create long-term credentials in each account to access those resources. However, managing all those credentials and
 * remembering which one can access which account can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term
 * credentials in one account and then use temporary security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming
 * roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html">IAM Roles (Delegation and Federation)</a> in
 * the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * For federation, you can, for example, grant single sign-on access to the AWS Management Console. If you already have an
 * identity and authentication system in your corporate network, you don't have to recreate user identities in AWS in order
 * to grant those user identities access to AWS. Instead, after a user has been authenticated, you call
 * <code>AssumeRole</code> (and specify the role with the appropriate permissions) to get temporary security credentials
 * for that user. With those temporary security credentials, you construct a sign-in URL that users can use to access the
 * console. For more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html#sts-introduction">Common Scenarios for
 * Temporary Credentials</a> in the <i>IAM User
 *
 * Guide</i>>
 *
 * By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> last for one hour. However, you can
 * use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value
 * from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value
 * from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session">View the
 * Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. The maximum session duration limit applies
 * when you use the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI operations but does not
 * apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html">Using IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User
 *
 * Guide</i>>
 *
 * The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> can be used to make API calls to any AWS service
 * with the following exception: you cannot call the STS service's <code>GetFederationToken</code> or
 * <code>GetSessionToken</code>
 *
 * APIs>
 *
 * Optionally, you can pass an IAM access policy to this operation. If you choose not to pass a policy, the temporary
 * security credentials that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are defined in the access policy of
 * the role that is being assumed. If you pass a policy to this operation, the temporary security credentials that are
 * returned by the operation have the permissions that are allowed by both the access policy of the role that is being
 * assumed, <i> <b>and</b> </i> the policy that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for the
 * resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use the passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of
 * those allowed by the access policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_assumerole.html">Permissions
 * for AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, and AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</a> in the <i>IAM User
 *
 * Guide</i>>
 *
 * To assume a role, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust
 * policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate access to this
 * account's role.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * The user who wants to access the role must also have permissions delegated from the role's administrator. If the user is
 * in a different account than the role, then the user's administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call
 * AssumeRole on the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user is in the same account as the role, then you can
 * either attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous different account user), or you can add the user as a
 * principal directly in the role's trust policy. In this case, the trust policy acts as the only resource-based policy in
 * IAM, and users in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission to assume the role. For more information
 * about trust policies and resource-based policies, see <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html">IAM Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User
 *
 * Guide</i>>
 *
 * <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * You can optionally include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call <code>AssumeRole</code>. This is
 * useful for cross-account scenarios in which you want to make sure that the user who is assuming the role has been
 * authenticated using an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition
 * that tests for MFA authentication; if the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role
 * is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following
 *
 * example>
 *
 * <code>"Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true}}</code>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html">Configuring
 * MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>
 *
 * guide>
 *
 * To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code>
 * parameters. The <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The
 * <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA devices produces.

 * The <code>GetFederationToken</code> action must be called by using the long-term AWS security credentials of an IAM
 * user. You can also call <code>GetFederationToken</code> using the security credentials of an AWS root account, but we do
 * not recommended it. Instead, we recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application and then
 * attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users to only the actions and resources that they need access to.

 * The temporary security credentials that are obtained by using the long-term credentials of an IAM user are valid for the
 * specified duration, from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximium of 129600 seconds (36 hours). The default is 43200
 * seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials that are obtained by using AWS root account credentials have a maximum
 * duration of 3600 seconds (1
 *
 * hour)>
 *
 * The temporary security credentials created by <code>GetFederationToken</code> can be used to make API calls to any AWS
 * service with the following
 *
 * exceptions> <ul> <li>
 *
 * You cannot use these credentials to call any IAM
 *
 * APIs> </li> <li>
 *
 * You cannot call any STS APIs except
 *
 * <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>> </li> </ul>
 *
 * <b>Permissions</b>
 *
 * </p
 *
 * The permissions for the temporary security credentials returned by <code>GetFederationToken</code> are determined by a
 * combination of the following:
 *
 * </p <ul> <li>
 *
 * The policy or policies that are attached to the IAM user whose credentials are used to call
 *
 * <code>GetFederationToken</code>> </li> <li>
 *
 * The policy that is passed as a parameter in the
 *
 * call> </li> </ul>
 *
 * The passed policy is attached to the temporary security credentials that result from the <code>GetFederationToken</code>
 * API call--that is, to the <i>federated user</i>. When the federated user makes an AWS request, AWS evaluates the policy
 * attached to the federated user in combination with the policy or policies attached to the IAM user whose credentials
 * were used to call <code>GetFederationToken</code>. AWS allows the federated user's request only when both the federated
 * user <i> <b>and</b> </i> the IAM user are explicitly allowed to perform the requested action. The passed policy cannot
 * grant more permissions than those that are defined in the IAM user
 *
 * policy>
 *
 * A typical use case is that the permissions of the IAM user whose credentials are used to call
 * <code>GetFederationToken</code> are designed to allow access to all the actions and resources that any federated user
 * will need. Then, for individual users, you pass a policy to the operation that scopes down the permissions to a level
 * that's appropriate to that individual user, using a policy that allows only a subset of permissions that are granted to
 * the IAM user.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * If you do not pass a policy, the resulting temporary security credentials have no effective permissions. The only
 * exception is when the temporary security credentials are used to access a resource that has a resource-based policy that
 * specifically allows the federated user to access the
 *
 * resource>

 * Returns a set of temporary credentials for an AWS account or IAM user. The credentials consist of an access key ID, a
 * secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use <code>GetSessionToken</code> if you want to use MFA to
 * protect programmatic calls to specific AWS APIs like Amazon EC2 <code>StopInstances</code>. MFA-enabled IAM users would
 * need to call <code>GetSessionToken</code> and submit an MFA code that is associated with their MFA device. Using the
 * temporary security credentials that are returned from the call, IAM users can then make programmatic calls to APIs that
 * require MFA authentication. If you do not supply a correct MFA code, then the API returns an access denied error. For a
 * comparison of <code>GetSessionToken</code> with the other APIs that produce temporary credentials, see <a

 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users">best practices</a> by
 * creating one or more IAM users, giving them the necessary permissions, and using IAM users for everyday interaction with

 *
 * </p </note>
 *
 * The permissions associated with the temporary security credentials returned by <code>GetSessionToken</code> are based on
 * the permissions associated with account or IAM user whose credentials are used to call the action. If
 * <code>GetSessionToken</code> is called using root account credentials, the temporary credentials have root account
 * permissions. Similarly, if <code>GetSessionToken</code> is called using the credentials of an IAM user, the temporary
