 * \brief The AcmpcaClient class provides access to the AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority (ACM-PCA) service.
 *
 * \ingroup aws-clients
 * \inmodule QtAwsACMPCA
 *
 *  You can use the ACM PCA API to create a private certificate authority (CA). You must first call the
 *  <a>CreateCertificateAuthority</a> function. If successful, the function returns an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for your
 *  private CA. Use this ARN as input to the <a>GetCertificateAuthorityCsr</a> function to retrieve the certificate signing
 *  request (CSR) for your private CA certificate. Sign the CSR using the root or an intermediate CA in your on-premises PKI
 *  hierarchy, and call the <a>ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate</a> to import your signed private CA certificate into
 *  ACM PCA.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  Use your private CA to issue and revoke certificates. These are private certificates that identify and secure client
 *  computers, servers, applications, services, devices, and users over SSLS/TLS connections within your organization. Call
 *  the <a>IssueCertificate</a> function to issue a certificate. Call the <a>RevokeCertificate</a> function to revoke a
 *  certificate.
 * 
 *  </p <note>
 * 
 *  Certificates issued by your private CA can be trusted only within your organization, not
 * 
 *  publicly> </note>
 * 
 *  Your private CA can optionally create a certificate revocation list (CRL) to track the certificates you revoke. To
 *  create a CRL, you must specify a <a>RevocationConfiguration</a> object when you call the
 *  <a>CreateCertificateAuthority</a> function. ACM PCA writes the CRL to an S3 bucket that you specify. You must specify a
 *  bucket policy that grants ACM PCA write permission.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  You can also call the <a>CreateCertificateAuthorityAuditReport</a> to create an optional audit report that lists every
 *  time the CA private key is used. The private key is used for signing when the <b>IssueCertificate</b> or
 *  <b>RevokeCertificate</b> function is called.
